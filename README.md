# CollectiveDynamics.jl

A Julia language package of different models of collective motion of self-propelled particles and the theoretical study of their emergent properties and the dynamical effects of different kinds of interactions and environments.

## Included Collective Motion Models 

### Simple Vicsek Model
Implementation of the Simple Vicsek Model within periodic boundaries condition introduced in *Vicsek, T., Cziro ́k, A., Ben-Jacob, E., Cohen, I. & Shochet, O. Novel type of phase transition in a system of self-driven particles. Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 1226–1229 (1995). DOI 10.1103/physrevlett.75.1226.* in 2D and 3D

### Behavioural Rules Model
Implementation of the Behavioural Rules Model introduced in *Couzin, I.D., Krause, J., James, R., Ruxton, G.D. & Franks, N.R., (2002) Collective memory and spatial sorting in animal groups. Journal of Theoretical Biology 218, 1-11.*

### Extended Inertial Spin Model
Implementation of the Inertial Spin Model introduced in *Cavagna, A. et al. Flocking and turning: a new model for self-organized collective motion. J. Stat. Phys. 158, 601–627 (2014). DOI 10.1007/s10955-014-1119-3.* extended with long-range interactions.

### Collective Motion Model with Short and Long-range Interactions
A Collective Motion Model based on short and long-range alignment interactions between particles in open space. Short-range interactions can be defined either metric or topologically.
